# Bar Drinks & Alcohol Guide (Structured)

> Purpose: a structured “bar encyclopedia” of what people commonly drink in bars, why ingredients are combined, and how the big families (beer, wine, spirits, cocktails, non-alcoholic) fit together.
>
> Note on “complete”: the real-world drink universe is effectively unbounded (new cocktails, local brands, seasonal beers, house specs). This guide aims to be **comprehensive in categories and templates** and **very broad in examples**.

## 1) Safety & context (quick)
- **Alcohol affects people differently** (body size, food, medications, sleep, tolerance). If you drink: go slow, hydrate, and don’t drive.
- Bars often use **standard pours** and measured recipes; home pours vary a lot.

## 2) Core concepts you hear in bars
### ABV, proof, and strength
- **ABV** = Alcohol By Volume (%). Higher ABV generally means stronger.
- **Proof** (US) = 2 × ABV (e.g., 40% ABV = 80 proof).
- Typical ranges:
  - Beer: ~3–12% ABV (most ~4–6%)
  - Wine: ~9–16% (most ~12–14.5%)
  - Fortified wine: ~15–22% (e.g., port, sherry)
  - Spirits: ~35–60% (most ~40%)
  - Cocktails: vary widely; often **8–25%** depending on length/dilution.

### Vintage, “NV”, and why people talk about it
- **Vintage (year)** on a wine label usually means the grapes were harvested in that year.
- **Why it matters**: weather and harvest conditions influence ripeness, acidity, tannin, aroma—so the same producer can taste different year to year.
- **NV (Non‑Vintage)**: common for Champagne & many sparkling wines; they blend multiple years to keep a consistent “house style.”
- **Aging**:
  - Not all wine improves with age; many are designed to drink young.
  - Aged wine can develop secondary/tertiary notes (leather, dried fruit, nutty, earthy) as fresh fruit notes mellow.

### The “balance” idea (why ingredients get combined)
Most mixed drinks exist to balance these:
- **Sweetness** (syrup, liqueur, vermouth, soda)
- **Acidity** (citrus, wine, shrubs)
- **Bitterness** (bitters, amaro, tonic, hops)
- **Alcohol heat** (base spirit)
- **Aroma** (citrus oils, herbs, smoke, spice)
- **Texture** (dilution, ice, egg white, cream)

### Dilution and temperature are ingredients
- Stir/shake with ice isn’t only for cold—it adds **controlled water**.
- More dilution = softer alcohol bite + different aroma release.

## 3) How bars measure and build drinks
### Common measures
- 1 oz ≈ 30 ml; 1.5 oz ≈ 45 ml; 2 oz ≈ 60 ml.
- “**Neat**”: room temp spirit poured in a glass.
- “**Up**”: chilled (usually shaken/stirred) and served without ice.
- “**On the rocks**”: served over ice.
- “**Top with**”: add soda/sparkling wine at the end.

### Techniques (and why)
- **Build** (in-glass): for highballs/simple mixes; preserves carbonation.
- **Stir**: for spirit-forward drinks (clarity, silky texture).
- **Shake**: for citrus/egg/dairy/fruit; adds aeration + chills fast.
- **Muddle**: extracts oils/juice from herbs/fruit.
- **Layer**: careful density-based float (often visual, sometimes aroma).

## 4) The main “drink families” in a bar

## 4A) Beer
### What it is
Fermented grain beverage (usually barley), flavored with hops.

### Major categories
- **Lager** (clean, crisp): Pilsner, Helles, Dunkel, Bock
- **Ale** (broader): Pale Ale, IPA, Stout, Porter, Saison
- **Wheat beers**: Hefeweizen, Witbier
- **Sour beers**: Gose, Berliner Weisse

### Why beer styles differ
- Yeast strain + fermentation temperature (lager vs ale)
- Hop variety and timing (bitterness vs aroma)
- Malt bill (bread/caramel/roast notes)

### Typical bar serves
- Draft pint, half pint, bottle/can
- Common add-ons: **beer + shot** (a “boilermaker” concept)

## 4B) Wine
### Still wine groups
- **Red** (tannins, darker fruit): Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah/Shiraz, Pinot Noir, Sangiovese
- **White** (acidity, lighter fruit): Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Grigio
- **Rosé** (many styles): dry and refreshing to richer versions

### Sparkling wine (Champagne and its “group”)
- **Champagne**: sparkling wine from the Champagne region of France, made under strict rules.
- Champagne styles you’ll hear:
  - **Brut** (dry), **Extra Brut**, **Brut Nature** (very dry)
  - **Blanc de Blancs** (white grapes only, usually Chardonnay)
  - **Blanc de Noirs** (dark grapes, e.g., Pinot Noir/Meunier)
  - **Rosé Champagne**
  - **Vintage Champagne** (single year) vs **NV**
- Other sparkling wines:
  - **Prosecco** (Italy)
  - **Cava** (Spain)
  - **Crémant** (France outside Champagne)

### Fortified and aromatized wines
- **Fortified**: Port, Sherry, Madeira, Marsala
- **Aromatized**: Vermouth (sweet/rosso, dry), quinquinas

### Serving basics
- Temp matters: whites cooler; reds slightly cool; sparkling cold.
- Decanting: mainly to aerate young tannic reds or separate sediment in older wines.

## 4C) Spirits (base alcohol categories)
### Whiskey / Whisky
- **Scotch** (often malt, sometimes peaty)
- **Bourbon** (sweet oak/vanilla)
- **Rye** (spicier, drier)
- **Irish**, **Japanese**, **Canadian**

### Gin
- Juniper-forward spirit; many styles:
  - London Dry (crisp)
  - Modern/New Western (more citrus/floral)

### Vodka
- Neutral profile; used for clean, simple cocktails.

### Rum
- White/light, gold, dark; also agricole; often tropical flavors.

### Tequila & Mezcal
- Both from agave; mezcal often smoky.
- Tequila styles: Blanco, Reposado, Añejo.

### Brandy / Cognac / Armagnac
- Distilled wine or fruit; rich, aromatic.

### Liqueurs, aperitifs, amari
- **Liqueur**: sweetened flavored spirit (triple sec, coffee liqueur).
- **Aperitif**: before-meal appetite openers (vermouth, Campari-style).
- **Amaro**: bitter herbal digestifs (many regional styles).

## 4D) Non‑alcoholic drinks (common in bars)
- Soda, tonic, ginger beer/ale
- Fresh juices, lemon/lime
- Coffee/espresso, tea
- “**Mocktails**”: cocktail-style drinks without alcohol

## 5) Cocktail architecture (the most useful way to learn “all cocktails”)
Instead of memorizing endless lists, learn templates. Most classics are variations of a few families.

## 5A) The classic templates (with typical ratios)
### 1) Sour template
- Structure: **Spirit + citrus + sweet**
- Typical: 2 : 1 : 1 (spirit : citrus : simple)
- Why it works: sweetness offsets acidity; spirit carries aroma.
- Examples: Daiquiri, Whiskey Sour, Margarita (with orange liqueur).

### 2) Old Fashioned template
- Structure: **Spirit + sugar + bitters + water (dilution)**
- Typical: 2 oz spirit + barspoon sugar/syrup + bitters
- Why it works: bitters add complexity; dilution smooths ethanol.
- Examples: Old Fashioned, rum old fashioned variations.

### 3) Martini / Manhattan template (spirit-forward, stirred)
- Structure: **Base spirit + fortified wine + bitters (optional)**
- Typical: 2 : 1 or 5 : 1 (drier)
- Why it works: vermouth adds botanicals, acidity, sweetness; stirring keeps it clear.
- Examples: Martini (gin+dry vermouth), Manhattan (whiskey+sweet vermouth).

### 4) Highball template
- Structure: **Spirit + carbonated mixer** over ice
- Typical: 1.5–2 oz spirit + 4–6 oz soda/ginger/tonic
- Why it works: bubbles lift aroma; lower ABV per sip.
- Examples: Gin & Tonic, Whiskey Highball, Rum & Coke.

### 5) Collins / Fizz template
- Structure: Sour + soda; sometimes egg white (Fizz)
- Why it works: a sour made “long” and refreshing.
- Examples: Tom Collins, Gin Fizz.

### 6) Negroni / bitter-forward aperitif template
- Structure: **Spirit + bitter + fortified wine**
- Typical: 1 : 1 : 1
- Why it works: bitterness + sweetness + botanicals in balance.
- Examples: Negroni, Boulevardier.

### 7) Tiki / tropical template (multi-ingredient)
- Structure: rum(s) + citrus + syrup + spice + bitters + crushed ice
- Why it works: layered aromas; high dilution keeps it drinkable.
- Examples: Mai Tai, Zombie (varies by bar).

## 5B) Why two (or more) ingredients are paired
- **Base + modifier**: A strong spirit needs a modifier to add complexity (vermouth, liqueur, amaro).
- **Acid + sweet**: citrus without sugar tastes harsh; sugar without acid tastes flat.
- **Bitters with sweet**: bitterness sharpens and prevents “cloying.”
- **Carbonation with citrus**: bubbles amplify acidity and aroma.
- **Aroma garnish**: citrus peel oils hit your nose first; it changes perceived flavor.

## 6) Big organized lists (common bar orders)
These are “widely known” drinks you’ll see on menus; specs vary by bar.

## 6A) Simple mixed drinks (2-ingredient staples)
- Gin & Tonic
- Vodka Soda
- Rum & Coke (Cuba Libre if lime)

- Tom Collins (build/shake+top)

## 6D) Sparkling / Champagne cocktails
- Mimosa (sparkling + orange)
- Bellini (sparkling + peach)
- French 75 (gin + lemon + sugar + sparkling)
- Kir Royale (sparkling + cassis)

## 6E) Creamy / dessert-leaning
- White Russian
- Espresso Martini (not always creamy, but dessert-adjacent)
- Irish Coffee
- Brandy Alexander

## 6F) Bitter / aperitif & digestif leaning
- Aperol Spritz (spritz family)
- Americano
- Paper Plane
- Last Word
- Espresso Amaro-style after-dinner pours (varies)

## 7) How to “talk bar” (terms from TV/bar scenes)
- **House pour / well**: standard bar brand used for mixed drinks.
- **Call**: you name the brand (e.g., “Tanqueray & tonic”).
- **Up / neat / rocks**: serving style.
- **Dry / wet**: often about vermouth amount (esp. martinis).
- **Dirty**: olive brine in a martini.
- **Straight** can be ambiguous; “neat” or “up” is clearer.

## 8) Quick ordering examples (practical)
- “Gin and tonic, please—**Tanqueray** if you have it.”
- “A **dry gin martini**, up, with a lemon twist.”
- “A **bourbon old fashioned**, not too sweet.”
- “A **margarita**, rocks, with salt (half-salt).”
